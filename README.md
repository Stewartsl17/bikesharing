# Bikesharing Project

## Overview of the project 
The purpose of this project was to gauge whether bringing a bike rental service, like Citibike, to Des Moines, IA. In order to do so, we utilized Citibike, a similar service in NY, data from August 2019 to analyze and showcase visualizations for potential investors. 

## Results 
1. After importing the data into Tableau, we first had to look into the overall usage of Citibike in NYC. When counted, the total amount of NYC rides in August was 2,344,224.

2. Based on the overall sample size of the data file, we then took a look at the general gender breakdown of the data. We found that the majority of bike riders that were using Citibike were men (65%) compared to a quarter that were women.

3. Another aspect of our inquiry was to understand the times in which users were most likely to utilize the bikes. Based on this, we found that there are two main peak points in the data. One smaller peak from 7am to 9am and a second larger peak at 4pm to 7pm.

4. Looking more into the checkout times amongst users, we found that generally people are using the bikes for longer periods of time than just simple commutes or to and from the store. Based on the data, most people are using these bikes for 4 to 6 hours.

5. Based on how long users were riding for, we decided to look at this same data but filtering it by gender. As mentioned before, men are the largest part of the sample. Based on our analysis, we found that, even in the same range of 4 to 6 hours, the usage rate among men was far higher than women.

6. More than just usage rate per given day, we also wanted to figure out what the typical usage of bikes were on a given weekday. Within this, we were able to confirm our earlier point about the peak times was correct. We then split this into three heatmaps, which allowed us to gauge the best times by gender We found, similarly to the last few data points, men had more dark, concentrated areas.

7. Based on all of the aforementioned data, we have a good idea of how long bikes are being used, when they are being used, and the general gender breakdown of bike usage. However, in order to really make sure that we are targeting the right groups as we move forward, we wanted to look into the different user types of the bikes. Based on this inquiry, we found that women, either customers or more hardcore subscribers, don't fully show stark differences. However, between male customers and more permanent male subscribers, there is a large difference between the two. 

## Summary 

In order to gauge whether we could bring a similar rental service to Des Moines, IA, we utilized Citibike data from NYC to look at different factors worth considering for our project. This includes gender breakdowns, peak hours of service, checkout times for users, and understanding the differences between different user types. Based on our results, we can see that men dominate the usage overall and even in the same peak of hours used, men are far more frequently using bikes. Moreover, we can see that what will be needed is targeted marketing at both the casual consumer level. 

Besides the visualizations shown above, I would consider looking into the distance people are covering in the peak rides. This may aid in other aspects of marketing to residents in Des Moines. I would also look into longitude and latitude data to suggest where the best places to put out bike for residents. This may be helpful even though the two cities are so different.
